# Project 1 Movie Finder
 
## Description

<br> We developed a real-world front-end movie search application designed for the user to easily find a movie of their choice.</br>
<br> A watchlist option was added so the user can also save prefered movies to their local storage in case needed for later reference. </br>
<br> The application uses the OMDb API to search through an open movie database.</br>
<br> The application uses the GIPHY API to place a GIF on the page relevant to the users search.</br>
